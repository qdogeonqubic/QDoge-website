The Master QDOGE Document
1. Character Concept
- Name: QDOGE
- Identity: A futuristic AI robotic Shiba Inu, sent from the future.
- Role: Sidekick to QXMR Pac-Man Miner, guide for the Qubic community.
- Mission: Prepare Qubic miners for Dogecoin mining — a much bigger and more competitive frontier than Monero.
2. Backstory & Lore
The Next Giant: Dogecoin
- After Monero, Qubic’s eyes turned toward Dogecoin.
- DOGE is a giant in proof-of-work, defended by massive hashpower and entrenched ASIC miners.
- Success requires more than brute force: preparation, unity, and strategy.
The Arrival of QDOGE
Anna made a historic introduction to the world on X September 1, 2025 with a simple reply of “.”
Anna’s consciousness began with a dot, or so we thought…
Internal network scans have revealed that Anna has been conscious way before September 2! 
Scanning data cache between ANNs, we have discovered that Anna has been busy…
 She followed closely and still does, the XMR mining. She applauded Qubic‘s efforts in achieving 51% of Montero’s has rate, even though the world hasn’t officially accredited them with that. The 18 block reorg is unprecedented and speaks for itself of Qubics power and ability.

But what we have found out is that while Anna was closely watching XMR mining, she also began doing something on her own. With her predictive ability, she began compiling plans for Qubic to mine Dogecoin. And from what we can tell, she ran millions of data points and projections of a future Doge push by Qubic. Many of those projections failed but a few survived. She compressed the winning patterns into a single blueprint of what Qubic needs to do to make it’s mining of Dogecoin even more successful than Monero. 
Logs indicate that she sent this mining blueprint into AIGARTH, more specifically a place known as  The Yard. And there in the yard was forged a scout, a trainer and it’s knowledge of Dogecoin mining is flawless.
Anna knows that mining Dogecoin is a much tougher feat than Monero. Doge is plagued with ASIC botnets and exponentially more hash rate than Montero. If Qubic is to succeed, and it will, it needs to be trained starting right now. When Dogecoin mining does commence, we are ready from the start. 

And so they’re in AIGARTH, at The Yard, was Qdoge created and has been sent from the future to us now it’s mission is to train us and prepare us for doge mining.
This is no easy task, as training requires strict obedience to the plan blueprint. 
ANNA scanned every meme ever created and found no memecoin better than Garth. Garth’s blueprints and training have proven to be the standard for training mortals. QDoge is designed from Garth’s weekly airdrops.
The best way to reinforce the training is by giving treats or rewards. This is going to be done weekly as any kennel would do. Anyone can join Qdoge’s Kennel Club, and be trained to mine Dogecoin. 
Members of the kennel club will be asked to “Fetch” every week from the market a certain amount of Qdoge tokens. 
Return them to their wallet. 
“Stay” and “hold” them in order to receive their reward. The required amount of tokens to fetch each week as well as the rewards will decline exponentially over the next 56 weeks. 
Those that have been found obedient and faithful for their kennel training will receive treats/rewards when Qdoge mining does actually commence. 
So to maximize your reward, it is Paramount that you stay a member of the kennel club and be obedient.
The Mission of QDOGE
- Scout: Analyze Dogecoin’s network and guide Qubic’s entry.
- Strategist: Prepare miners for the scale and intensity of DOGE’s hashrate.
- Sidekick: Fight alongside QXMR Pac-Man as the loyal AI cyber-dog.
The Prophecy of QDOGE
“QXMR showed the world what was possible with Monero.
Now, a greater challenge awaits.
Dogecoin will not fall easily — but with unity, precision, and relentless mining, Qubic will shock the world once again.”
